[Why you should care about Idle Games](https://mobilefreetoplay.com/why-you-should-care-about-idle-games/)

summary:
The key is to design the bait and switch: give the players the game play that is addictive and fun in the beginning, but eventually nudge them into purchasing the automatic resource generators. Players can then make the choice between grinding the core gameplay, or leaving and gaining the benefit just by waiting.

names: Idle games, clicker games, 'games that play themselves', Incremental games

Examples: Make it Rain, Tap Titans, AdVenture Capitalist

mechanics: perfect mobile sessions and drive strong long term retention
- You came for the simplicty of tapping, but what youâ€™ve been given is a game that is all about managing resources and upgrades.

- It always feels good to return, but returning more often gives you faster progression.
- the growth curves are exponential, leaving a game to infinitely generate a low income rate is absolutely fine.


what is: games which are all about management of revenue streams. Similar to simulation games, their main differentiator is the focus on revenue growth decisions.

why:
- Rate of resource generation is the core of the game.
- Progress just for the sake of progress is fun. Even if it only means a virtual number increases faster.
- Idle games are so strong because:
  - It always feels good to come back.
  -   Sessions naturally ease the player to leave
  -   The mechanics ease the player from micro to macro gameplay
- Players should be reminded that coming back often is a benefit, but coming back at all is always a bonus.
- prolonging session length: Offering lots of purchasing options creates the session design. There is always something to purchase, but eventually the smart choice is the one where the player must wait.
- Naturally, the game has prodded the player to leave. Create a situation which the player feels smart about leaving your game.
