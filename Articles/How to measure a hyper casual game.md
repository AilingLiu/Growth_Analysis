**KPI Categories**
- in app performance in the game (what are they?)
- UA

User funnel -- look at user journey and monetizaton

### User acquisition

**cost per install (CPI)**

Solution: Optimize ASO(App Store Optimization), such as relevant keywords; Keep the CPI campaign set-up relevant to target group that reflect their needs, from the text (call to action) down to design, and be consistent across different channels.

Outcome: lowering CPI; organic installs leading to better retention from targeted users, more revenue.

Benchmark Conversion rates of the App Store for hyper-casual games are:
  - CR: From the store page visitors to installs, the CR benchmark is from 20 to 30%
  - CTR: from an impression to the click, the CTR benchmark goes from 2.5 to 4% for games in general
  - CPI: from 0.02 (tier 3 countries) to 0.5 (tier 1 countries)

**organic uplift**

what - calculated as the number of organic users acquired per each non-organic user

why - the higher the organic uplift, the more organic installs and the lower effective CPI;

 if you don’t track your organic installs, once you decrease your UA investment, the keywords you rank for will decrease as well. Your app store ranking will then decrease as a result, organic downloads will decrease and your CPI will be higher.

**retention rate**

what - the stickiness of the game

how - for hyper-casual game, check day 1 and day 7 retention rate after user acquired on day 0; for other games: check day 14 and day 30 as well.

benchmark - hyper-casual game: day 1: 40% from users acquired on day 0;
day 7: 15% of the users acquired on Day 0.

## Monetization

**Average Revenue per User**

what - along side with APRDAU, it's the amount of revenue driven from one player on average. It's calculated by dividing the revenue for a selected time period by the active users from that time period.

how - build cohort of the user, (start on the same day), and look at their ARPU.

why - as an indicator of LTV; determine the limits for CPIs.

**engaging metrics**

what - metrics to indicate if users are engaging with your app; building up your player base

metrics: retention, session length, stickiness and number of sessions

**LTV**
why - gives you the limits of how much you should pay for each user you get into the game (paid installs).

Ideally, to have a game that makes revenue, your CPI should be lower than the LTV.

**Return On Advertising Spend (ROAS)**

**Effective Cost per Thousand Ad Impressions (eCPM)**

What - it represents the overall effectiveness of your game and the quality of users that you’re attracting to it.

 The higher the quality of users are as a result of UA, the better your overall eCPM will be from ad networks, and the higher your overall revenues will be.
