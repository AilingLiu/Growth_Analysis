by *Daniel Stammler* on Feb 10, 2019

### Start
- 60M+ installs,
- 10m+ monthly active users

### Games are hit-driven business
Find out the game that players want to play; continue if it happens

### Building a MVP
* 1st phase: text boxes --> is it fun? One week of development
* 2nd phase: build graphics --> play again, iterate on the graphics
* ...
* 8 weeks work

### Challenge at the start
- many many ideas, focus on the primary goal: not to build a good game, but a game you can test if you should actually spend the time to make the game better

### Important measurement: D1 retention
- D1 retention: 75%
Result: we can now build the game

### Our process at start
- small team, agile, one function one person, no discussion required
- start
- minimum product
- internal testing, play internally
- external testing, released on google play
  - ift(Idle factory tycoon) publish from another account (reduce organic bias)
  - not to mess up with imt(idle miner tycoon)
- scaling up

### weekly updates
- close to player, addressing players interest and feedback
- 120 updates, games as a service instead of a finished product, continue to improve the game as long as there are players

### update policy
- one sprint one update, one week
- process
  - game design work ahead of the dev team (plan new features about a week in advance)
  - game art
  - dev team - fully focus on developing
  - qa: test features during dev phase, resolving bugs, issues

### Continuous Integration (CI)
- CI platform: Jankins

### staged rollout
- release the update to small portion of users, gradually release to all users
- 1% users, check Daily Users, check bugs, issues
- 5% users, check issues on the updates, check with community; this is the time to roll back if the feature is not expected
- 20% uers, collect user feedback and store reviews
- 100% android
- 100% ios

### be player-centric and connect to players
- connect to players with social media
- why players play or don't play our games
- the actual issues behind the issue
- ranking, reviews

### what to do the player feedback
- weekly community representation, talk to dev, product, game designers
- show list in one slide
- connect community with developers

### timeline
- 2016: content (no iap)
- 2017: implement shop (iap)
- 2017: events
- 2018: social light
- 2018: mainland
- 2019: super manager

### others
- do ab testing on the store
