## how to monetize hyper-causal games

- monetize source: ads
- factors to consider during ad implementation: session length, number of sessions per day
- [rewarded video](https://www.ironsrc.com/rewarded-video-monetization/):
  - generate more revenue for developers
  - compared to interstitial and banner ads, increasing retention and session length
  - incorporate rewarded video by adding different layers to games, or providing various valuable rewards such as gems, extra lives, time
  - 40% plus engagement rate, 4 impressions per user per day are good goals to aim for
  - interstitials and banner ads
    - types of interstitials: static, video, playable, with/out skip button
    - how many ads shown per second;
    - if more aggressive approach, i.e. more impressions per second, will generate higher ARPDAU(average revenue per daily active user), but may hurt retention
    - balance user experience and monetization to maximize LTV and ARPU, best way: find the set up that generates the highest LTV using AB testing. Benchmark: aiming 3 impressions per session
    - implement tailored ad for different segments:
      - users engage with rewarded video and make purchases (ad whales), take softer approach
      - users generate zero revenue through iaps or rewarded ads, taking more aggressive approach yielding more revenue
